          The online world is at a critical inflection point as it applies to data , and we’re either crazy or confident enough to find a better solution. The way data is collected and sold will change radically in the next
          ten years. We aren’t trying to change the internet: we’re building a platform that gives data creators agency around their private data, while offering developers, advertisers, and researchers a transparent, fair, and appropriate route to compliance for their data collection tools. We are building a marketplace for data — where consumers benefit – that will naturally evolve in the next chapter of the internet’s evolution over the next few decades.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">Through StreamS and RiverBank, we are building a model for consumers to benefit from the data they want to share and for businesses and advertisers to gain access to deeper, better data. The world needs a platform that focuses on de-identified data: River is ready to deliver.</p>

        <p class="p3 --no-vmargin">Who we are.</p>
        <p class="p1 --no-vmargin">We are a dynamic team of professionals from around the globe: entrepreneurs, innovators, hackers, futurists, and marketers, all deeply experienced and passionate about data rights and responsibilities. The time has come to create an appropriate data environment: one that gives users control over the data they own.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="p3 --no-vmargin">What we're doing.</p>
        <p class="p1 --no-vmargin">River is more than a technical solution to an emerging issue. It’s a multi-stream collaboration between users and organizations interested in the private data being created. We are building a data platform that enables users to profit from the data they generate, with an interface that enables developers, organizations, and advertisers to remain compliant with current and emerging laws about privacy around the world. We are creating an ecosystem that makes it possible for people to choose what, where, how, and when their data is being used. Privacy is a by-product of our improved design.</p>
