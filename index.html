          Websites and businesses collect oceans of data about you and your
          family, all day, every day. Information like how you slept last night,
          how many pounds you gained over the holidays, where you like to shop,
          which games you like to play, what shows you like to watch, how many
          times you ordered pineapple on your pizza, and so much more. Every
          single action in your day can be boiled down to a data point, and this
          information is used by big corporations to nudge you towards buying
          things you don't want and don't need. Companies pay big money for your
          data, but they're getting far more than they need. River helps you get
          paid for the info you're willing to sell while protecting the data you'd
          like to keep private.

          Through legislation in the US and around the world, it's been made
          crystal clear to marketers and app-developers that you own your own
          data. The problem is, you can't really do anything with it. Yet. <br />
          River gives you full control over which services have access to your data, and
          for how long they can have it. And we can help enterprises and
          organizations quickly and easily comply with US and global laws designed
          to protect your privacy. Our business model works by giving you control
          over your data and by providing a platform that makes compliance
          accessible for developers and marketers.
