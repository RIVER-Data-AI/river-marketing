      <p>River gives you control over your data.</p>
      <p>
        Websites and businesses collect oceans of data about you and your
        family, all day, every day. Information like how you slept last night,
        how many pounds you gained over the holidays, where you like to shop,
        which games you like to play, what shows you like to watch, how many
        times you ordered pineapple on your pizza, and so much more. Every
        single action in your day can be boiled down to a data point, and this
        information is used by big corporations to nudge you towards buying
        things you don't want and don't need. Companies pay big money for your
        data, but they're getting far more than they need. River helps you get
        paid for the info you're willing to sell while protecting the data you'd
        like to keep private.

      <p>Who Owns Your Data?</p>
      <p>
        Through legislation in the US and around the world, it's been made
        crystal clear to marketers and app-developers that you own your own
        data. The problem is, you can't really do anything with it. Yet. River
        gives you full control over which services have access to your data, and
        for how long they can have it. And we can help enterprises and
        organizations quickly and easily comply with US and global laws designed
        to protect your privacy. Our business model works by giving you control
        over your data and by providing a platform that makes compliance
        accessible for developers and marketers.
