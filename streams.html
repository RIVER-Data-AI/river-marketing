        <p class="p1">Through StreamS, River’s social media platform, you can share your data, your way. Create a visually stunning image for your closest friends, made from the data generated by shopping at your favourite café or songs from your favourite band. The image is lovely on its own, and
          you get to choose who can know the true meaning of the information inside. Your fans can see the beauty of your data, while you choose who can have the context.</p>
        <p class="p3 --no-vmargin">Beyond social</p>
        <p class="p1 --no-vmargin">StreamS helps you share the absolute bare minimum required to process an application, sign up for a service, or buy a product online. When you sign in to StreamS, you have control over your data: you get to choose who can see it, how they can use it, and for how long they can access it.</p>

          StreamS may be the coolest thing to happen to social media since the advent of the thumbs-up. For a sense of what we mean, check-out this “Dear Data” project from RIVER friend Giorgia Lupi, and her colleague Stefanie Posavec.
