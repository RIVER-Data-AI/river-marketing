        StreamS, River's social media platform, enables you to share your data,
        your way. When you have control over your data, you get to choose who
        can see it, how they use it, and for how long they get to access it.
      </li>

      <li class="p1">
        <p class="p1">
          StreamS helps you share the absolute bare minimum required to process
          an application, sign up for a service, or buy a product online.

          Get paid for your likes and shares without compromising your security
          or identity. Or when you're asked for your ID, they only need to see
          the ID – not your full address. Or when you are applying for credit,
          River lets you share only the information relevant to your application
          – not everything else about you.

        Data visualization tools let you create graphically stunning
        representations of your data without revealing anything other than the
        information you want to share.

        The possibilities are endless, and there's no wrong way to safely share
        your data.
