    <p class="p1">Your data is a new asset class – like your car. Your house. Your ten-season box set of Friends on DVD.</p>
    <p class="p1">RiverBank is a marketplace where you can sell, lease, or rent your de- identified data to organizations eager to pay for it: businesses, Big Tech, app developers, and advertisers. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
    <p class="p1">RiverBank is your digital wallet, where you can store the fiat money earned from your data. Pay in and pay out, securely, easily, and directly with hard cash, not digital coins. Stop giving away your data.
